Basics of Django

First Project created in Django to learn more and increase the competancy level.


## For Dynamic data
We can use dictionary to pass the data from backend to template file

## Word Counter
Create a html in template to show the result, in views.py added the code to do processing, and routes added in urls.py

## Using POST method
By using POST method we are making our website more secure as the strings passed by user is not shown in url, also by default in django csrf token is used which enhances the security
